# django-imageupload

This is a repository made by me (of course, isn't it?) but all the project ideas are from BlueLime Learning Stodio from Udemy.

I'm learning Django.

Uh... I'm bad at writing readme lol

The point is, I'm trying.

If you really read this readme until this line, I just want to say thank you and please support me!
